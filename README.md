# RinnACR
 
Playing around ACR, don't expect me to do anything, source code available so you can do it yourself !
put these in your minion directory "X:\MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\ACR\CombatRoutines\"
will add then as i make them.

I don't intend to add some buttons or reactions, not interested in content that would require it.

if you want something worth buying think about https://wiki.mmominion.com/doku.php?id=ffxivminion_acr_index !
